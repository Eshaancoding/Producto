    "What is something is haunting you from the past? What if, in your subconscious mind, that you don't want to face your demons and you don't accept yourself for who you are? What are your demons?" :   "He felt a lot of this. His dad abused his mom and himself severely. Later, he and his mother left the dad, but had to leave Trunnis, his brother. His mom remarried, and they had a good life for a while. But the new husband was shot in the middle of the street. He was traumatized and couldn't learn, so he cheated. He was at the center of a extremely racist place. There was a lot of demons that was creeping up David Goggin's shoulder. But the first key step, is just to recognize those demons. List them out. Feel the rage. Because you will use these excuses to fuel your ultimate success.",

    "David Goggins was at a really low point of his life. He had a dream of getting into the Air Force. But he still had so much trauma. He was called the n-word everywhere he gone. He is still traumatized by Wilmoth's death. He had received death threats from other people at school. And his latest report card came out: with an average GPA of 1.43. At this point, his dream of getting into the Air Force was a big dream. He wanted it badly, but there was so many obstacles ahead of him. What did he do?"   :   "Later, after taking a shower, he took a good look at himself in the mirror. He hated what he saw himself. He then said, \"Look at you. Why do you think the Air Force want your punk ass? You stand for nothing. You are an embarrassment. You are one dumb motherfucker. You read like a third grader. You're a fucking joke! You've never tried hard at anything in your life besides basketball, and you have goals? That's fucking hilarious. You don’t see people in the military sagging their pants. You need to stop talking like a wanna-be-gangster. None of this shit is gonna cut it! No more taking the easy way out! It’s time to grow the fuck up! It's on you!“ Yeah, I know shit is fucked up. I know what you’ve been through. I was there, bitch! Merry fucking Christmas. Nobody is coming to save your ass! Not your mommy, not Wilmoth's. Nobody! It’s up to you!\" He would then use his mirror as a tool for him to be more serious about life. He took post-it notes and stick them into the mirror. It had goals like, \"Pull up your pants!\" and \"Make your bed like you're in the military everyday!\" He was raw and real, and honest when he looked into the mirror.You are stopping you!",

    "David Goggins has organized his life in a much better manner. However, his mind is still not rock stone. This is evident when he quit the Air Force, because of he is scared of the water and his Sickle Cell Anemia. When the doctor suggested to quit out of the Air Force, he agreed and did it. He then overeat. He started to weight 175 pounds in 1994, but then weighted 290 pounds in in 1999. He buried his fear and insecurities with eating. He saw a Navy SEAL commercial and was inspired. He wanted to become one, like how he wanted to become a Air Force. But he was 290 pounds! He found out that he had less than 3 months to lose 106 pounds. How is he going to do it? When he took run, he only lasted 400 yards before he was panting hard. What mindset does he need to obtain in order to accomplish this goal?"  :   "I turned off the television and thought about my own life. It was a life devoid of any drive and passion, but I knew if I continued to surrender to my fear and my feelings of inadequacy, I would be allowing them to dictate my future forever. My only other choice was to try to find the power in the emotions that had laid me low, harness and use them to empower me to rise up, which is exactly what I did. I dumped that shake in the trash, laced up my shoes, and hit the streets again. On my first run, I felt severe pain in my legs and my lungs at a quarter mile. My heart raced and I stopped. This time I felt the same pain, my heart raced like a car running hot, but I ran through it and the pain faded. By the time I bent over to catch my breath, I’d run a full mile. That’s when I first realized that not all physical and mental limitations are real, and that I had a habit of giving up way too soon. I also knew that it would take every ounce of courage and toughness I could muster to pull off the impossible. I was staring at hours, days, and weeks of non-stop suffering. I would have to push myself to the very edge of my mortality. I had to accept the very real possibility that I might die because this time I wouldn’t quit, no matter how fast my heart raced and no matter how much pain I was in.",

    "He was under going Hell Week, which is an intense program that Navy SEALs had to undergo. However, it was hard for him. Especially, the water training. David Goggins wasn't well suited to the water, especially that he sinks everytime he touches the water. So the pain that he endured was extreme. Even worse, his instructor (Psycho Pete) verbally berated him, as well as splashing water onto his face to limit his breathing. It was horrible, and he was undergoing so much pain. So what did he do? How did he fight back against not just Psycho Pete, but the water?"  :   "Time stood still as I realized for the first time that I’d always looked at my entire life, everything I’d been through, from the wrong perspective. Yes, all the abuse I’d experienced and the negativity I had to push through challenged me to the core, but in that moment I stopped seeing myself as the victim of bad circumstance, and saw my life as the ultimate training ground instead. My disadvantages had been callousing my mind all along and had prepared me for that moment in that pool with Psycho Pete. Similar to using an opponent’s energy to gain an advantage, leaning on your calloused mind in the heat of battle can shift your thinking as well. Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. And when you leverage a calloused mind like I did around the pool that day and keep fighting through pain, it can help you push your limits because if you accept the pain as a natural process and refuse to give in and give up, you will engage the sympathetic nervous system which shifts your hormonal flow.",

    "Even after surviving intense training from his instructors, and his preparation to be even considered in the Navy, he was out. The problem was his knee; it looked so bad that the doc said for him to sit out. Thankfully, he had a chance to re-enter the Navy. However, he was given one chance. If he blows it, it's over. But, truth to be told, he was scared to under go it again. The brutal training. The mental breakdowns. He didn't want to live it again. Not only that, he realized that he got pregnant. He was still in debt! How was he able to raise another child? He was thinking that life, and everything, was against him. \"She left me alone, and I sat on that couch all night. I felt like I’d been stripped of everything, but I was still breathing, which meant I had to find a way to keep going. I had to compartmentalize doubt and find the strength to believe that I was born to be more than some tired-ass Navy SEAL reject. After Hell Week I’d felt I had become unbreakable, yet within a week I’d been zeroed out. I hadn’t levelled up after all. I still wasn’t shit, and if I was going to fix my broke-down life, I would have to become more! \" " : "By then I’d learned how to hold myself accountable, and I knew I could take a man’s soul in the heat of battle. I had overcome many obstacles, and realized that each of those experiences had calloused my mind so thick, I could take on any challenge. All of that that made me feel like I’d dealt with my past demons, but I hadn’t. I’d been ignoring them. My memories of abuse at the hands of my father, of all those people who called me nigger, didn’t vaporize after a few victories. Those moments were anchored deep in my subconscious, and as a result, my foundation was cracked. In a human being your character is your foundation, and when you build a bunch of successes and pile up even more failures on a fucked-up foundation, the structure that is the self won’t be sound. To develop an armored mind—a mindset so calloused and hard that it becomes bulletproof—you need to go to the source of all your fears and insecurities. True, I had been dealt a fucked-up hand, but that night I started thinking of it as running a 100-mile race with a fifty-pound ruck on my back. Could I still compete in that race even if everyone else was running free and easy, weighing 130 pounds? How fast would I be able to run once I’d shed that dead weight? I wasn’t even thinking about ultras yet. To me the race was life itself, and the more I took inventory, the more I realized how prepared I was for the fucked-up events yet to come. Life had put me in the fire, taken me out, and hammered me repeatedly, and diving back into the BUD/S cauldron, feeling a third Hell Week in a calendar year, would decorate me with a PhD in pain. I was about to become the sharpest sword ever made!",

    "It was in BUD/s training, which consisted of intense training in running and in the water. David Goggins needed to survive BUD/s training, or else he is not cut out to be the man that he dreams to be. But here's the problem, not just that BUD/s training was hard, he was doing it on TWO broken legs. Even by the slightest touch, he would undergo intense pain. Now imagine that he had to use these legs in order to survive on of the hardest and intense training of all time? He felt like giving up. The odds are stacked heavily against him. But did he really do that? After everything he been through? What will he do?" : "And this was just the first run in what promised to be five months of continual pain. Was it possible to survive this, day after day? I thought about quitting. If failure was my future and I’d have to rethink my life completely, what was the point of this exercise? Why delay the inevitable? Was I fucked in the head? Each and every thought boiled down to the same old simple question: why?“ The only way to guarantee failure is to quit right now, motherfucker!” I was talking to myself now. Silently screaming over the din of anguish that was crushing my mind and soul. “Take the pain, or it won’t just be your failure. It will be your family’s failure!”I imagined the feeling I would have if I could actually pull this off. If I could endure the pain required to complete this mission. That bought me another half mile before more pain rained down and swirled within me like a typhoon. “People have a hard time going through BUD/S healthy, and you’re going through it on broken legs! Who else would even think of this?” I asked. “Who else would be able to run even one minute on one broken leg, let alone two? Only Goggins! You are twenty minutes in the business, Goggins! You are a fucking machine! Each step you run from now until the end will only make you harder!” That last message cracked the code like a password. My calloused mind was my ticket forward, and at the forty-minute mark something remarkable happened. The pain receded to low tide.",

    "He was running a marathon in order to challenge himself. He was always looking for new ways to push himself, even if that meant that he would go through in a world of pain. But he wasn't prepared to run a marathon. It takes a different level and different strong muscles in order to become good at long-distance running, and he wasn't used to it. The pain was becoming real to him. His quads throbbed, and his feet were chafed and bleeding. That simple question rose again. \"Why are you doing this to yourself? Why run a hundred fucking miles without training? Why was I doing this to myself?\" This was the main question that David Goggins wanted to answer. So how did he overcome this immense pain?" : "That’s when I finally realized that this fight wasn’t about Operation Red Wings or the families of the fallen. It was to a point, but none of that would help me run nineteen more miles before 10 a.m. No, this run, Badwater, my entire desire to push myself to the brink of destruction, was about me. Why? he asked. It’s funny, humans tend to hatch our most challenging goals and dreams, the ones that demand our greatest effort yet promise absolutely nothing, when we are tucked into our comfort zones. But those answers are very important when you are no longer in your air conditioned room or under your fluffy blanket. When your body is broken and beaten, when you’re confronted with agonizing pain and staring into the unknown, your mind will spin, and that’s when those questions become toxic. If you aren’t prepared in advance, if you allow your mind to remain undisciplined in an environment of intense suffering (it won’t feel like it, but it is very much a choice you are making), the only answer you are likely to find is the one that will make it stop as fast as possible... He then employed the Cookie Jar: where he remembered all the times previously that made himself proud. Like the time when I had to study three times as hard as anybody else during my senior year in high school just to graduate. That was a cookie. Or when I passed the ASVAB test as a senior and then again to get into BUD/S. Two more cookies.These weren’t mere flashbacks. I wasn’t just floating through my memory files, I actually tapped into the emotional state I felt during those victories, and in so doing accessed my sympathetic nervous system once again.",

    "He was running another marathon, and a really hard one. Not only was he running for prolong periods of time, but he also had to run in the dark. The temperature was dropping and the rain was still pissing down. He was at the very edge of his capability, and wasn't sure that he could take one more step. In other words, it felt like he had drained 99% of his tank. So how do you push yourself when pain is all you feel with every step?" : "He started to remember that you are only 40% of what you are capable of, and you have to remove the governor from your mind. The human body is like a stock car. We may look different on the outside, but under the hood we all have huge reservoirs of potential and a governor impeding us from reaching our maximum velocity. In a car, the governor limits the flow of fuel and air so it doesn’t burn too hot, which places a ceiling on performance. It’s a hardware issue; the governor can easily be removed, and if you disable yours, watch your car rocket beyond 130 mph. It’s a subtler process in the human animal. Our governor is buried deep in our minds, intertwined with our very identity. It knows what and who we love and hate; it’s read our whole life story and forms the way we see ourselves and how we’d like to be seen. It’s the software that delivers personalized feedback—in the form of pain and exhaustion, but also fear and insecurity, and it uses all of that to encourage us to stop before we risk it all. But, here’s the thing, it doesn’t have absolute control. Unlike the governor in an engine, ours can’t stop us unless we buy into its bullshit and agree to quit. Sadly, most of us give up when we’ve only given around 40 percent of our maximum effort. Even when we feel like we’ve reached our absolute limit, we still have 60 percent more to give! That’s the governor in action! Once you know that to be true, it’s simply a matter of stretching your pain tolerance, letting go of your identity and all your self-limiting stories, so you can get to 60 percent, then 80 percent and beyond without giving up. I call this The 40% Rule, and the reason it’s so powerful is that if you follow it, you will unlock your mind to new levels of performance and excellence in sports and in life, and your rewards will run far deeper than mere material success.",

    "He was participating in the Ironman World Championships. It was a brutal race, which starts with a 2.4-mile swim followed by a 112-mile bike ride, and closes with a marathon run. There is also blistering heat conditions and brutal winds. But he didn't just wanted to win the Ironman, no he wanted to have the title of the Ultraman. He would have to swim 6.2 miles, ride 261 miles, and run a double marathon. But it doesn't stop there. He had to also go to various school and talk about himself, essentially recruiting with other people. He had two full-time jobs, so how did he manage between both of them?" : "He created a schedule. You must evaluate your life in its totality! We all waste so much time doing meaningless bullshit. We burn hours on social media and watching television, which by the end of the year would add up to entire days and weeks if you tabulated time like you do your taxes. You should, because if you knew the truth you’d deactivate your Facebook account STAT, and cut your cable. When you find yourself having frivolous conversations or becoming ensnared in activities that don’t better you in any way, move the fuck on! It’s up to you to find ways to eviscerate your bullshit. How much time do you spend at the dinner table talking about nothing after the meal is done? How many calls and texts do you send for no reason at all? Look at your whole life, list your obligations and tasks. Put a time stamp on them. How many hours are required to shop, eat, and clean? How much sleep do you need? What’s your commute like? Can you make it there under your own power? Block everything into windows of time, and once your day is scheduled out, you’ll know how much flexibility you have to exercise on a given day and how to maximize it. If you audit your life, skip the bullshit, and use backstops, you’ll find time to do everything you need and want to do. But remember that you also need rest, so schedule that in. Listen to your body, sneak in those ten- to twenty-minute power naps when necessary, and take one full rest day per week. If it’s a rest day, truly allow your mind and body to relax. Turn your phone off.",

    "David Goggins was raising money for the specialops organization. However, he wanted to do so by breaking the Guinness World Records for the most amount of pull-ups in 24 hours. This was no easy task, as the previous record was set 4,020. But he failed. Not only did he failed himself, he failed in front of everyone in TV. So did he give up? What did he do?" : "So did I hang my head in shame and misery? Fuck no! To me a failure is just a stepping stone to future success. The next morning, my phone was blowing up so I left it in my hotel room and went for a run in Central Park. I needed zero distractions and time enough to go back through what I’d done well and where I’d fallen short. In the military, after every real-world mission or field exercise, we fill out After Action Reports (AARs), which serve as live autopsies. We do them no matter the outcome, and if you’re analyzing a failure like I was, the AAR is absolutely crucial. Because when you’re headed into uncharted territory there are no books to study, no YouTube instructional videos to watch. All I had to read were my mistakes, and I considered all variables. First of all, I should never have gone on that show. My motivation was solid. It was a good idea to try to increase awareness and raise money for the foundation, and while I required exposure to raise the amount I’d hoped, by thinking of money first (always a bad idea) I wasn’t focused on the task at hand. To break this record, I needed an optimal environment, and that realization blasted me like a surprise attack. I didn’t respect the record enough going in. I thought I could have broken it on a rusty bar bolted to the back of a pick-up truck with loose shocks, so even though I tested the bar twice before game day, it never bothered me enough to make a change, and my lack of focus and attention to detail cost me a shot at immortality. There were also way too many bubbly looky-loos buzzing in and out of the room, asking for pictures between sets. This was the beginning of the selfie era, and that sickness most definitely invaded my motherfucking safe space. Obviously, my break was too long. I figured massage would counteract the swelling and lactic acid build-up, but I was wrong about that too, and I should have taken more salt tablets to prevent cramping. Before my attempt, haters found me online and predicted my failure, but I ignored them and didn’t fully absorb the hard truths couched in their negativity. I thought, as long as I trained hard, the record would be mine, and as a result, I wasn’t a well-prepared as I should have been."
