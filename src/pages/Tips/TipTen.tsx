No, he wanted to break the Guinness Book of World Records for the most pull-ups. But he failed. He didn't succeed, and he fell short, even after everything of learning how you can callous your mind and become the best you can possibly be. So did he just hang in shame and misery? Hell no.", 
                "He employed a technique called the After Action Reports. This is where you analyze your mistakes and shortcomings. The first mistake he took was that he should have never gone to that show. He wasn't focused on the task at hand, since all he was thinking was money (this was always a bad idea). To break the record, he needed an optimal, quiet environment, and that was the first realization. He also figured that his break was way too long. The massage does not counteract with the swelling and lactic acid building up, so he should have taken more salt tablets to prevent cramping. He also researched about gymnast chalk, gloves, taping systems, as well as nutrition (added bananas and some protein).",
                "But he failed again. His palms were bloody as hell, and he couldn't take it anymore. When he drove  back to the hospital, his mom said to him, 'Well, I know one thing. You're going to do this again.' This is importance of friendship. Surround yourself friends who would rather push you to do your best rather than surround ourselves with people who speak to our desire for comfort. His mom was a perfect example of this.",
                "For the second time, he first brainstormed everything that went well, because in every failure there was a lot of good things will have happened, and we must acknowledge them. First, the gym environment was absolutely perfect to his need. The tape and chalked worked as well, since it got him an additional 700 pull-ups. He was also surrounded with very respectful people.", 
                "He was also doubting himself if he could every accomplish this record, but then he thought about Roger Bannister. He was trying to break the four-minute mile in 1950s, but every expert told him it couldn't be done, but it didn't stop him. He failed and failed again, but he eventually got it. Six weeks later, over 1k runners have done what was once thought ot be beyond human capability. We let experts to cap our potential. Now was the thing that needed to fix for hte next attempt. He first started to start slower to go further. He also knew that at the 10 hour mark he would feel like giving up, so he told himself to stay true to his own strategy and limit any long breaks to 4 minute max.",
                "He would also have to do something about that pull up bar. He needed some way to protect his hands, so he experimented with all different types of gloves to find which is the best. He also got approved to get form-fitting pads onto his hands, and after it was approved. He smashed the Guinness World Records for the most pull-ups."]
