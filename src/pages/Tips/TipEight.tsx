This was almost a full time job, but he also wanted to run ultra-marathons and be in great shape. This is where you employed a schedule to balance between two full-time jobs: his recruitment process to the Navy SEAL as well as participating in a great number of ultra-marathons.",
                "He would wake up at 3 A.M, and arrive at the trailhead at 4 A.M. He would then power hiking up one of Colorado's 58 summits above 14k feet. Then we'd spring down the mountain to strengthen our quads. He then would repeat this beginning at 9 A.M and so on. He was inspirational. So much so that one of the students that he talked with drove 2 hours just to see him race. You never know who you're affecting.",
                "If you want to master the mind and remove the governor, you'll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, evn talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.It is the single most important factor if David Goggin's accomplishments. There are others like him too. His friend Mike is a big-time financial advisor in New York City, but he's also an ultra-marathon runner. How does he balance this? He wakes up a 4 a.m every weekday and run 60 to 90 minutes and rides a bike to work and back. He also does a quick 30 minute treadmill run after he gets home. He's wealthy as hell, and could easily enjoy the sweet fruit of his labors, but no he works hard.",
                "Evaluate your life in totality! You waste so much time doing meaningless bullshit. We burn hours on social media and watching television. You find yourself having frivolous conversation with other people, and arguing in useless disputes! So it's up to you to find ways to eviscerate your bullshit. How much time do you spend at the dinner table talking about nothing after the meal is done? How much social media do you spend? When do you sleep? Put a time stamp on all of them.",
                "These are all detriment to your goals. Analyze your schedule, kill your empty habits, burn out the bullshit, and see what's left. Maximize your day, and prioritized tasks every hour of the day. Include backstops in your day-to-day schedule (recognize the environment around you, and mark what you are doing, where you, and the desired course of action to achieve the goal). Use your smartphone for productivity hacks, not click bait. Turn on your calendar alerts. Have those alarms set. Allow your body to truly rest and allow your mind and body to relax. Turn your phone off! Keep the computer shut down! Hang out with friends and family, eat and drink well, so you can recharge and get back at it again!"]
