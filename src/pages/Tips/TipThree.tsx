He also had worked on a gig where you clean out rats and other disgusting insects. How did he end up like this? Well his biggest weakest was swimming. In the navy, swimming was really important and therefore, the training was extremely intense. But David Goggins wasn't buoyant. He failed and failed and failed. He asked himself, \"What the fuck are you doing here? this isn't for you! You can't swim! You're an imposter and they will find you out!\" Later on, a doctor said that he had Sickle Cell Trait, and that lead him to quit the Air Force", 
                "He then started to eat a lot. Before he was 175 pounds, now he was 300 pounds, eating a large chocolate milkshake and mini chocolate doughnuts. However he got inspired when a commercial about Navy SEAL. \"In a society where mediocrity is too often the standard and too often reward\" But in order to get into the Navy SEAL, he had to lose 106 pounds in less than 3 months. He tried to take a run, but only lasted 400 yards. \" Who the fuck did I think I was? I was born nothing, I'd proven nothing, and I still wasn't worth a damn thing. David Goggins, a Navy SEAL? Yeah right \" ", 
                "He then found a VHS copy of Rocky. Rocky was fighting someone who was extremely experienced, and he was beat so badly that his trainer urged him to stay down. But he didn't hear it. He pulls himself up to one knee, then all fours. \" The fight isn't over yet \" ",
                "If David Goggins knew that he would continue to surrender to his fear, and it would decide is future instantly. So the ONLY other choice, was to try to find the power in the emotions that had laid me low, harness them to empower to rise up, which is exactly what I did. He got back upt or un, and he did feel the same pain but he ran through it and the pain faded. He realized that he had a habit of giving up way too soon, and it would take every once of courage and toughness to muster up the impossible.", 
                "He successfully cut weight, and was ready to become a SEAL Navy Member. He did this by doing the uncomfortable, time and time again."]
